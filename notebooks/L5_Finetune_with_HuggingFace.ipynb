    "# Lesson 5 — Fine-tune a Small Pretrained Model (Hugging Face)\n",
    "**Goal:** Use the `transformers` library to fine-tune a compact GPT-style model on your custom corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How this connects to previous lessons**\n",
    "- Lessons 1–4 taught you how to build each component from scratch. Now you’ll stand on the shoulders of a pretrained model and *nudge* it toward your style of text.\n",
    "- Fine-tuning adjusts millions of weights slightly so the model prefers your data (e.g., Minecraft diaries or sci-fi mission logs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vocabulary check**\n",
    "- **Pretrained model:** A network already trained on a giant dataset. We just adapt it.\n",
    "- **Checkpoint:** A saved bundle of model weights and configuration.\n",
    "- **Dataset / Data collator:** Objects that feed tokenized text into the trainer with the right shapes.\n",
    "- **Learning rate:** Controls how big each weight update is. Too high → instability, too low → very slow progress.\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** When the model memorizes the training sentences instead of learning their style. Monitor validation loss or sample generations to catch this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan of attack**\n",
    "1. Pick a tiny pretrained model (e.g., `sshleifer/tiny-gpt2`) so it trains quickly on CPU.\n",
    "2. Load or build a tokenizer. You can reuse Hugging Face’s tokenizer or plug in the one you made earlier.\n",
    "3. Create a dataset from your `.txt` files in `data/`, chunk it into blocks, and feed it into the Trainer API.\n",
    "4. Configure training arguments (epochs, batch size, learning rate) and launch training.\n",
    "5. After fine-tuning, generate text and compare it to the base model’s output—does it sound more like your stories?\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Tip: Keep runs short at first (e.g., 100–300 steps). Quick experiments teach you how hyperparameters affect results without waiting forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ This requires internet (to download the model) and a Python environment with `transformers`, `datasets`, and `accelerate`. A CPU will work for a tiny run; GPU is faster.\n",
    "> If you *don’t* have internet, skip to the fallback at the bottom (use the tiny transformer from Lesson 4)."

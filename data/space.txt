TITLE: Space Stories â€“ Dogonauts and Creeper Comets
The Dogonauts launched from the Minecraft Moon. Their ship, the Bone Voyager, drifted past sparkling nebulae.
Captain Luna (a golden retriever) barked commands: 'Stay on course toward the Creeper Comet!'
The crew checked oxygen and fuel. Stars flickered like pixels. A distant station beeped: 'Docking approved.'
Meanwhile, a curious robot named WOOF-42 learned new words by reading star logs.
